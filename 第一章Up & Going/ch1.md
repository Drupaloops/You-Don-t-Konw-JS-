###Chapter 1: Into Programming

Welcome to the You Don't Know JS (YDKJS) series.

欢迎来到你不懂JS（YDKJS）系列。

Up & Going is an introduction to several basic concepts of programming -- of course we lean toward JavaScript (often abbreviated JS) specifically -- and how to approach and understand the rest of the titles in this series. Especially if you're just getting into programming and/or JavaScript, this book will briefly explore what you need to get up and going.

Up & Going章节是编程的一些基础概念的介绍－当然，我们特别地学习倾向于JavaScript（通常简称JS）－以及如何处理和理解这一系列的其它标题。尤其是如果你刚刚进入编程或者JavaScript领域，这本书将会简要探讨为了变得Up & Going你需要什么。

This book starts off explaining the basic principles of programming at a very high level. It's mostly intended if you are starting YDKJS with little to no prior programming experience, and are looking to these books to help get you started along a path to understanding programming through the lens of JavaScript.

这本书从一个很高的层次出发对编程的基本原理进行解释。它主要是为了如果你在开始阅读YDKJS时几乎没有任何编程经验，而且你在寻找这些书籍来帮助你开始沿着一条路线通过JavaScript这个镜头来理解程序设计。

Chapter 1 should be approached as a quick overview of the things you'll want to learn more about and practice to get into programming. There are also many other fantastic programming introduction resources that can help you dig into these topics further, and I encourage you to learn from them in addition to this chapter.

第一章应该被当作一个你想要了解更多并且练习来进入编程世界的事物的快速的概述。还有很多其他的能够帮助你深入挖掘这些主题的精彩的编程介绍资源，而且我鼓励你除了本章之外从他们那里学习。

Once you feel comfortable with general programming basics, Chapter 2 will help guide you to a familiarity with JavaScript's flavor of programming. Chapter 2 introduces what JavaScript is about, but again, it's not a comprehensive guide -- that's what the rest of the YDKJS books are for!

一旦你对一般的编程基础感到舒适，第二章将会帮助引导你熟悉JavaScript的特点。第二章介绍了什么是JavaScript，但是它不是权威指南－－这就是YDKJS这本书剩下的部分的内容！

If you're already fairly comfortable with JavaScript, first check out Chapter 3 as a brief glimpse of what to expect from YDKJS, then jump right in!

如果你已经能够相当舒适地使用JavaScript，首先翻到第三章简单瞥一眼看看你期待从YDNJS中得到什么，然后跳进去吧！

####Code

Let's start from the beginning.

让我们从头开始。

A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly into a developer console in a browser, which we'll cover shortly.

一个程序通常指的是源代码或者只是代码，它是一系列特殊指令来告诉电脑要运行什么命令。通常代码是保存在文本文件中的，尽管使用JavaScript的时候你也可以直接在浏览器的开发者控制台中敲代码，这个我们会在稍后介绍。

The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.

指令的有效格式和组合的规则称作伊恩计算机语言，有时也被称为它的语法，就像英语告诉你如何拼写单词以及如何用单词和标点符号创造有效的句子一样。
